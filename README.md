# Wallet Manager Flutter Mobile APP

Wallet Manager is a simple and user-friendly app designed to help you track your expenses effortlessly. With customizable features, you can create your own spending categories and manage multiple wallets. Gain insights into your spending habits by identifying your top categories and viewing detailed reports of your daily averages and category expenditures.

This project marks my initiation into Flutter Mobile App development. It was born out of a personal need to streamline my financial management. I aimed to create an app that was not only intuitive but also packed with features to enhance user experience.

From designing the frontend interface to implementing various functionalities, I navigated both frontend and backend development challenges. One of the highlights was tackling the task of storing data locally on users' devices, which presented a rewarding challenge.

In summary, Wallet Manager served as my hands-on learning journey into Flutter Mobile development. While it may seem straightforward to experts, for me, it was a gratifying challenge that enabled me to acquire valuable skills and knowledge.
